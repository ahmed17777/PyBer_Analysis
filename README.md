## Project Overview 
The purpose of this project was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a visualization of Ridesharing data for our client, V. Isualize. Inthis project, we have done the analysis and created a multi-line graph that shows weekly fares for each city type in the dataset. The following is a report of how the data differs by city type. 

## Results 
By analyizing the PyBer ride sharing data, we came up with the following pivot table that provides an overview and summary of the data:

Some of the key findings include:
- Urban cities have the highest demand for riders 
- Rural cities have the lowest demand for riders 
- Rural cities have the highest fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver 
- Urban cities conversely have the lowest fare per ride and average fare per driver 
- Despite the higher fare per ride and driver, Rural cities get a fraction of the total fares that Urban cities collect

## Summary 
Based on our analysis, our recommendations to PyBer are the following: 
- Reallocating drivers based on demand could benefit PyBer immensely. Currently, the demand for rides in the Urban regions is far lower than the amount of drivers being allocated, which is the opposite for suburban and rural regions. Allocating drivers to meet the demands for those regions could result in increased total fares, as these regions currently do not have enough drivers to maxmimize fares. These regions also have higher fare per ride, which can result in increased earnings.
